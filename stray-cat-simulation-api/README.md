# Stray Cat Simulator

Welcome! For this project I created a stray cat simulator game using a javascript front-end and rails active record back-end. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone this repository and run bundle install then rake db:migrate. You can then run rake db:seed to populate the database with some cats. Be sure to setup your database in database.yml. I recommend using postgreSQL for asyncronous calls to the database.
